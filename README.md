# PSYCH-755-Final

This repository is for the final assignment in Psych 755. It includes a Google Colab notebook with a sentiment analysis neural network project using Keras's imdb database. 
For the purpose of this project, I have combined the use of GitHub, Google Colab, Neural Networks, and a repo from a public source (Keras) to demonstrate the knowledge I have accumulated over the course of this summer term.
